## 📌 Overview of Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Rule-Based Chatbot

**Description:**  
Build a basic **rule-based chatbot** for simple conversational interactions. This chatbot can:

- Respond to greetings  
- Share information about itself  
- Tell jokes and interesting facts  
- Provide the current system time on request  

The chatbot continues interaction until the user types `"bye"` to exit.

> 💡 **Learning Focus:**  
> - Rule-based logic  
> - String pattern matching  
> - Basic NLP concepts

### 🎮 Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI (Minimax Algorithm)

**Description:**  
Create a fully functional **Tic-Tac-Toe game** with a GUI using **Tkinter**. This game includes:

- **Single-player mode** with a smart AI opponent (Minimax algorithm)  
- **Two-player mode** for human vs. human gameplay  
- Clean and interactive **Graphical User Interface**  
- Easy **reset functionality** for replayability  

> 🧠 **Learning Focus:**  
> - Game development fundamentals  
> - GUI design with Tkinter  
> - AI logic using the Minimax algorithm

### 🎬 Task 3: Rule-Based Movie Recommendation System

**Description:**  
Develop a **simple movie recommendation engine** using rule-based logic in Python. The system recommends movies based on:

- Preferred **genre**  
- Favorite **actors**  
- Chosen **director**  

This serves as a starting point for more advanced recommendation systems.

> 📈 **Learning Focus:**  
> - Rule-based conditional logic  
> - User input handling  
> - Fundamentals of recommender systems
